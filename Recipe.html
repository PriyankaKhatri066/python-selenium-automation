    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place oven rack to middle position.</li>
        <li>Butter (or spray with a non stick vegetable spray) the bottom and sides of a 9 x 5 x 3 inch (23 x 13 x 8 cm) loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom of the pan with a piece of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Stir in the chopped nuts.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl combine the mashed bananas, beaten eggs, melted butter, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, lightly fold the wet ingredients (banana mixture) into the dry ingredients just until combined and the batter is thick and chunky. (The important thing is not to over mix the batter. You do not want it smooth. Over mixing the batter will yield tough, rubbery bread.)</li>
        <li>Scrape batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake until bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 to 70 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place on a wire rack to cool and then remove the bread from the pan.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or at room temperature. This bread can be frozen.</li>
